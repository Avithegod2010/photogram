## v0.3 — Core loop (F1–F4) + quick wins (S1–S3)

**Added in this commit**
- **F1 Masonry Gallery**: FlashList v2 masonry, Days/Months/Years pinch levels, date badges, upload-state dots, keyset paging.
- **F2 Viewer**: swipe, pinch zoom 4×, video playback, metadata sheet, Share/Archive/Hide/Delete.
- **F3 Upload Engine**: SQLite-persistent queue to Saved Messages, 1.5GB→5s throttle, FLOOD_WAIT reactive backoff, live progress, Pause/Resume.
- **F4 Scanner**: device library scan with dedupe gate + 320px thumbnails.
- **S1 · Free Up Space**: Settings → Device Storage shows how many GB of originals are safely in Telegram; one tap removes local copies (thumbnails stay, gallery still browsable offline).
- **S2 · Trash with 30-day countdown**: Collections → Trash is now real — thumbnails with days-left badges, Restore, Delete-Forever (removes from Telegram too). Auto-purge runs on app start.
- **S3 · Upload quality setting**: "Storage saver" recompresses photos >2048px to ~85% JPEG before upload; videos always stay original. Default: Storage saver.

**Next plan**
- S4 Search by date/tag/filename
- S5 Memories ("On this day") carousel
- S6 Map view from GPS EXIF clusters
- Then: phone build (`npx expo run:android`) for first end-to-end test
